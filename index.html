      <h1 class="intro-line">About Me</h1>
  </div>

      <p> I hold a bachelor of arts in International Affairs and French and a minor in Anthropology. It was my successful language learning endeavors that helped prove to me I would be capable of learning programming languages. My professional experience in the non profit field has often led me to be a "jack-of-all-trades" and having to do everything from organizing events to meeting professional meetings to grant writing to translating documents and helping young people through crises, leading me to thrive in an environment where I have to learn new things quickly and on the fly, as web developers must often do in their constantly changing field. For a more detailed summary of my professional experience and journey to becoming a web developer, I've included a FAQ and my full resume on my <a href="faq.html">"Learn More"</a> page.</p>

    <h2 class="intro-line">Get to know me....</h2>
      <p>A lot of people start out describing themselves by responding to such simple questions as "Where are you from?" This is a bit of a loaded question in my case- as I've lived all over the place. Nonetheless, I think it's safe to say that the fact that I've "lived all over" has been a defining part of who I am, allowing me to develop into the person I am today: someone who adapts to new situations fast, looks around at the world and how he can help others on a global scale, and someone who is just beginning to have a small grasp on how large the world is and how much remains for me to explore. It was in this spirit that I decided to pursue a career in web development. If you've got any other "personal" questions, please do not hesitate to <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a> with me.</p>

       I'm becoming a web developer to help satisfy my ever growing curiosity of learning how the world around me works. Although it's hard to believe- I've probably been using the internet for 20 years now, maybe even longer, but I never really knew how the things I was looking at works. I think it was time to change that. Plus, I wanted to develop a new transferable skill. It never hurts to have a new skill and we all have to reinvent ourselves to continue to grow.

        It all began back in may at the suggestion of my friend, who's a Web Developer. Initially I thought it "wasn't for me," but after taking the HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery courses available on CodeAcademy, I became hooked. After I completed those, I was hungry for more, so my friend would write out some problems for me on Javascript to build those skills a bit. Eventually, I decided that it would be sort of "force" myself to be accountable if I invested my own money into a course. I heard of CareerFoundry through a friend. The price is absolutely unbeatable- which is another reason why I chose to become a web developer: the fact that it is a skill that doesn't really require a degree and if it came down to it, you could even learn it for <strong>free</strong> if it really came down to it, which is more relevent than ever, particularly in my country, where much of my generation is experiencing underemployment and will be caught in the cycle of debt for potentially the rest of their lives.

        My current job involves working with immigrant students in high school, helping acculturate them into their new lives in the United States and equipping them with the knowledge and tools they need to pursue meaningful careers. Working with these students is an incredible opportunity on so many levels. However, as I begin to appreciate more and more the value of technology (partially a perspective I've gained from working with people who might come from backgrounds where they did not have access to technology)- I have only just begin to realize the potential of technology to help educate people around the world. For the first time in history, all people need is a device that can connect to the internet as well as an internet connection to essentially access the sum of all human knowledge. While I don't think I have any sort of "developmentalist" worldview, I believe that almost all human beings can benefit from the Internet in a way that pays respects to their individual cultural needs. My long term professional goals as a web developer would be to be work for a company that uses technological solutions to solve the world's problems. Take a country like Afghanistan for example, which has extremely few qualified medical professionals in proportion to its population. Perhaps a joint public/private sector effort could bring internet connections to remote areas of the country, connect people with some kind of tablets or computer, allowing these people to gain medical knowledge via Massive Open Online Course (MOOC's) led by trained medical professionals.

        The feeling of creating something new and success. So far, I've made this simple site and done everything I've done through trial and error. When you work hard getting a function to work, when you fiddle with the element of a page and then are able to get the page to look like how you envision in your head, it is a truely rewarding feeling.
